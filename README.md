## Project:

### **Project Name: Building a Lottery Website with Anonymous Rewarding Feature using Blockchain Technology** 

### **Project Detail:**


#### **General:**

Instead of centralize data in a database (or distributed database locate geographically) with access rights belong to one person only. We're builing a lottery website in which everyone has the same rights.

Everyone can have access to the lottery data. 

But the data still have some credentials: 

- User can only read their own transaction.
- Their own wallet
- User will browse data anonymously

#### **Feature in developement:**

- User register in the system will be granted a wallet address.
- Like online games. Currency unit in the system will be coin or token (ETH, Bitcoin, .etc).
- Use system's currency unit to play
- Pool based on cumulative ticket purchase + reward
- One turn may/may not have a winner
- A winner will be rewarded with token (or coin)
- Exchange coin

## **On learning:**
